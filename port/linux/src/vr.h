/*
VR.H

The VR mode (HALO_VR; port/linux/README.md, "VR"): what the game's code
(port/linux/game/vr_render.c, render.c, player_control.c), the renderer
(d3d8_gl.c) and the input (xinput_sdl.c) ask of vr.c. Plain C types only:
the game's code includes it as well as the platform layer.

The game draws one view from the centre of the head, its field of view the
union of both eyes', and the renderer draws each of its draws into both eyes
at once (GL_OVR_multiview2), each vertex's clip position moved from the
centre view's to its eye's by a fixed transform per eye (halo_vr_set_eye_
transforms). The HUD and the menus go to a layer of their own.

Game axes: forward, left, up (the game's x, y, z at a yaw of 0).
