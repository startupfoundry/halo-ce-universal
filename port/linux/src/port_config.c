/*
PORT_CONFIG.C

The native ports' settings (port_config.h), parsed with tomlc17
(port/third_party/tomlc17). Every setting is in the table below with its
type, default, the HALO_* environment variable that overrides it and the
comment written into a new file. The file is read once, on the first
question; unknown keys and values of the wrong type are reported in the log
and the defaults used instead. A setting the player has not set is written
commented out at its default ("# vsync = true", CONFIG_DEFAULTS_NOTE), so
that a newer default reaches it; otherwise the file only gains the settings
it lacks (config_add_missing) and the lines config_write sets, so that the
player's edits and comments stay. display.graphics chooses the drawing's
settings the player has not set (config_graphics), and battery saver reads
them at their "classic" values while it is on (config_battery_saver_set).
