XGPU_MSL.H

Metal Shading Language from the shader intermediate form (xgpu_shader.h),
for the Metal backend (the native macOS app): xgpu_msl.c. The programs are
the GLSL emitter's (xgpu_glsl.c), spelled for Metal and its conventions:

- clip space is Direct3D's (z 0 to 1, the first row at the top): the
  position is the one the game's programs mean, nothing flipped;
- vertex attributes come through a vertex descriptor ([[stage_in]]): the
  attributes a program reads, at [[attribute(n)]] for v<n>. A D3DCOLOR is
  MTLVertexFormatUChar4Normalized_BGRA (the shader reads it as RGBA, as
  GL_BGRA gives it); NORMPACKED3 is MTLVertexFormatUInt, unpacked here; the
  unnormalized shorts (D3DVSDT_SHORT1-4) are MTLVertexFormatShort1-4, read
  as integers and converted here (Metal converts no integer format to
  float); everything else is read as float4, the missing components 0, 0,
  0, 1. An attribute the program reads that the declaration lacks is the
  device's (D3DDevice_SetVertexData4f, 0, 0, 0, 1 at first): a buffer with
  MTLVertexStepFunctionConstant;
- the vertex constants (192 float4) are buffer XGPU_MSL_BUFFER_CONSTANTS of
  the vertex stage (setVertexBytes: 3 KB); the draw's other values, struct
  xgpu_msl_uniforms, buffer XGPU_MSL_BUFFER_UNIFORMS of both stages
  (setVertexBytes and setFragmentBytes);
- a texture and a sampler for each stage, [[texture(n)]] and [[sampler(n)]];
  Metal samplers have no LOD bias, so D3DTSS_MIPMAPLODBIAS is the lookup's
  (texture_lod_bias, as on OpenGL ES);
- border colors Metal cannot hold (it has transparent black, opaque black
  and opaque white; the motion tracker's is 0x46000000): the sampler clamps
  to the edge, and the shader mixes the stage's color in where the
  coordinates leave the texture (xgpu_msl_options border);
- the VR mode's views are not (the Mac app is flat): a key's multiview is
  drawn as none, a layered render target as its first layer.
