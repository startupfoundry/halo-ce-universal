/*
XGPU_SHADER.H

The shader intermediate form: the NV2A's programs decoded once, every bit
field resolved, for the emitters to write in a shading language (GLSL and
ESSL: xgpu_glsl.c). nv2a_vsh.c decodes vertex programs, nv2a_psh.c pixel
shaders.

The form is the hardware's own operations, typed: these programs have no
control flow, a few dozen kinds of operation, and each kind has a spelling
in every target language, so an emitter is a walk over the form and a table
of spellings.
