/*
VR_HOST.H

What the VR mode (HALO_VR, vr.c) asks of OpenXR, which the host does
(port/linux/arm64/host_vr.c): the session, the swapchains, the frame loop,
the poses and the controllers. On the Linux arm64 build the game is guest
code with 32-bit pointers that cannot call OpenXR, whose structures hold
64-bit pointers and handles, so these structures hold only 32-bit integers
and floats, laid out alike on both sides, and the swapchains' images are GL
texture names.

Poses are in the play space: OpenXR's (metres; x right, y up, z backwards),
the stage when standing, the local space when seated. Field of view angles
are tangents: left and down negative.
