/*
VR_GRENADE.C

The VR mode's grenade thrown with the left hand (HALO_VR; vr.grenade_throw =
"gesture", port/linux/README.md "VR"): the game's side of the gesture that
port/linux/src/vr.c sees, for player_control.c, units.c and
first_person_weapons.c.

The game throws a grenade in an animation: the throw button starts the
unit's throw animation (unit_throw_grenade_begin), its third frame puts the
grenade in the unit's left hand (unit_throw_grenade_move_to_hand), and its
key frame lets it go (unit_throw_grenade_release), from just before the
eyes, along the aim, at the unit's grenade velocity; let go before then (the
animation cut short), it is thrown more weakly, by the share of the ticks to
the key frame it was held. The first-person weapon plays a throw animation
of its own beside it (first_person_weapons.c), which lowers the weapon and
marks no release.

The hand's swing presses the throw button (vr.c, as the left trigger),
through the game's input and the netcode as any throw is; the hand's
release then times the throw: the animations (the unit's, which others see,
and the first-person one, released on the unit's key frame) wait on the
frame before the key frame while the hand still holds the grenade, and go
on to it at once when the hand lets go sooner, the grenade put in the hand
first if it is not yet there. The grenade then leaves from the hand, along
the hand's throw, as hard as the hand threw it (never harder than the
game's throw). With the hands the controllers' (vr.hands), the first-person
throw is not played: the left hand is the player's own, and the weapon
stays in the right. While the hand throws, the player's facing turns along
the throw (player_control.c), which the netcode carries: a host's or
another player's copy of the throw, released when its own animation lets
go, goes the same way.

From the grip taking it until the game throws it, the grenade (the current
type's projectile's model) is drawn in the left hand, in the first-person
pass, whatever the hands; the game's own grenade hangs from the hand of the
player's body, which is not drawn in first person. The thrown grenade
starts where the held one was drawn last, and is drawn from there
(render_interpolation_object_from), not from the body's hand.
