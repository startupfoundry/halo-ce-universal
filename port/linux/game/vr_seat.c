/*
VR_SEAT.C

The VR mode's view from a vehicle's seat (HALO_VR; vr.vehicle_view,
vr.seat_motion, port/linux/README.md "VR"), for vr_render.c, and its
automated test.

With vr.vehicle_view = "first_person" the eye is in the seat, and the game
animates the seated body: getting in is most of a second of climbing (the
eye swept 2.7 to 3.4 m, up to half a metre a frame), getting out a third of
a second to a second (1.7 to 2.7 m), and a turret's seat swings about the
turret's pivot as it aims (the Shade's eye some 0.65 m from it), with
flinches when hit. None of
that is the player's own motion. With vr.seat_motion = "still" the eye stays
where it is in the vehicle instead: as the body climbs in, where it was
standing; once seated, where the head then is, until the player is out; and
it moves between those (and from the seat to where the player stands, once
out) in a blink: the view darkens with the eye held, the eye moves in the
dark, and the view lightens. The vehicle's own motion it rides with, and
the view stays level and turned by the head and the stick alone
(vr_render.c). Any other jump of the eye between the game's camera and the
seat's, or between the game's first-person camera and the one following a
vehicle (vr.vehicle_view = "third_person"), is blinked through the same way:
the director cuts between those cameras in the VR mode (director.c) rather
than flying between them for a second.

debug.vr_test_seat seats the first player in the nearest vehicle's seat
whose label has the given text in it ("gunner", "driver", ...), standing at
its entrance (put there two seconds before), as the action button does (unit_enter_seat: the seat's entering animation), and
takes them out as it does (unit_try_and_exit_seat) some seconds later. From
a second before getting in to a few seconds after getting out, each frame's
centre camera is logged against the last's, how far it moved and turned,
with the phase (on foot, entering, seated, exiting) and the blink's
darkness, and each phase's sums as it ends: the view's motion the player
did not make, with the head held still (debug.vr_test_head = "0"), and how
much of it was seen (not in the dark).

Called from the main loop every frame (main.c), with each VR frame's centre
camera (vr_render.c), and in the eye pass (render.c).
